# # **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**
# ***
# In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip "raw-lines-example.mp4" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below.
#
# Once you have a result that looks roughly like "raw-lines-example.mp4", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video "P1_example.mp4".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.
#

# Let's have a look at our first image called 'test_images/solidWhiteRight.jpg'.  Run the 2 cells below (hit Shift-Enter or the "play" button above) to display the image.
#
# **Note** If, at any point, you encounter frozen display windows or other confounding issues, you can always start again with a clean slate by going to the "Kernel" menu above and selecting "Restart & Clear Output".
#
# ---

# **The tools you have are color selection, region of interest selection, grayscaling, Gaussian smoothing, Canny Edge Detection and Hough Tranform line detection.  You  are also free to explore and try other techniques that were not presented in the lesson.  Your goal is piece together a pipeline to detect the line segments in the image, then average/extrapolate them and draw them onto the image for display (as below).  Once you have a working pipeline, try it out on the video stream below.**

# ## Reflections
#
# Congratulations on finding the lane lines!  As the final step in this project, we would like you to share your thoughts on your lane finding pipeline... specifically, how could you imagine making your algorithm better / more robust?  Where will your current algorithm be likely to fail?
#
# Please add your thoughts below,  and if you're up for making your pipeline more robust, be sure to scroll down and check out the optional challenge video below!
#

# ## Submission
#
# If you're satisfied with your video outputs it's time to submit!
#

# ## Optional Challenge
#
# Try your lane finding pipeline on the video below.  Does it still work?  Can you figure out a way to make it more robust?  If you're up for the challenge, modify your pipeline so it works with this video and submit it along with the rest of your project!
